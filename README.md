## Research

### Representations, cohomology, and geometry of Lie superalgebras

I am studying the relative cohomology ring of a Lie superalgebra relative to a reductive even subalgebra. I conjecture that this relative cohomology ring is finitely generated, which I hope can be showed via a spectral sequence argument. Once this is established I will investigate the natural mappings of support varieties in the spirit of Friedlander and Parshall's "Support varieties for restricted Lie algebras."

This research relies heavily on work by Benson, Boe, Carlson, Friedlander, Gruson, Hochschild, Kujawa, Nakano, Parshall, and Serre.

### Tropical geometry, algebra, and Grassmannians

The Grassmannian is often identified with the image of the Plucker embedding into projective space. This variety is isomorphic to the GIT quotient of the space of d x n matrices by the natural action of GL(d). There has been much interest in defining tropical analogues of the Grassmannian, with several constructions due to Speyer and Sturmfels. With Dr Noah Giansiracusa, I have been working on an analogue that mimics the GIT construction. We have discovered many interesting similarities, and many interesting differences when compared to the classical theory.

This research relies heavily on work by Fink, G Giansiracusa, N Giansiracusa, Rincon, Speyer, and Sturmfels.
